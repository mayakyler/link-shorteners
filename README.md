## Motivation

Our motivation for building and maintaining this repository stems from our experience building [y.gy](https://app.y.gy/), a link shortening platform. Facing challenges such as spam via other link-shortening platforms, we created this list to empower developers to efficiently block unwanted/spam links in destination URLs. By utilizing this package, you can enhance the security and integrity of your platform, making it a safer space for users.

## Trusted Link Shorteners

We do not include in this list a handful of link shorteners that are trusted to always lead to legitimate corporate pages:

- a.co (Amazon)
- g.co (Google)
- discord.gg (Discord)
- do.co (DigitalOcean)

If you represent a major trusted website that uses a shortener only for internal links, let us know and we'll put it on this list.
